## SOLID Principles in Java (Interview Prep)

**What are SOLID Principles?**

SOLID is an acronym representing five fundamental principles of object-oriented design and programming. Coined by Robert C. Martin ("Uncle Bob"), they aim to make software designs more understandable, flexible, maintainable, and testable. Adhering to SOLID helps create robust and scalable systems.

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

*   **Core Idea:** A class should have only **one reason to change**, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.
*   **Why it Matters:**
    *   **Reduced Coupling:** Changes related to one responsibility don't affect unrelated ones.
    *   **Improved Cohesion:** Class members are logically related.
    *   **Easier Testing:** Simpler to test a class with a single focus.
    *   **Better Readability/Maintainability:** Easier to understand what a class does.
*   **Code Example:**

    ```java
    // --- BEFORE SRP (Violation) ---
    class Report {
        private String data;

        public Report(String data) {
            this.data = data;
        }

        public String generateReport() {
            // Logic to format the report
            System.out.println("Generating report with data: " + data);
            return "Report Content: " + data;
        }

        public void saveToFile(String fileName) {
            // Logic to save the report content to a file
            System.out.println("Saving report to file: " + fileName);
            // File I/O operations...
        }
        // PROBLEM: This class does two things: generating and saving.
        // If saving logic changes (e.g., save to DB), this class needs modification.
        // If report format changes, this class also needs modification. -> Two reasons to change.
    }

    // --- AFTER SRP (Adherence) ---
    class ReportGenerator {
        public String generateReport(String data) {
            System.out.println("Generating report with data: " + data);
            return "Report Content: " + data;
        }
    }

    class ReportPersistence {
        public void saveToFile(String reportContent, String fileName) {
            System.out.println("Saving report '" + reportContent + "' to file: " + fileName);
            // File I/O operations...
        }
        // Can add saveToDatabase, saveToCloud etc. here or in separate classes.
    }

    // Usage:
    // ReportGenerator generator = new ReportGenerator();
    // ReportPersistence persistence = new ReportPersistence();
    // String report = generator.generateReport("Some Important Data");
    // persistence.saveToFile(report, "my_report.txt");
    ```
*   **Explanation:** The `Report` class initially handled both generation and persistence. This violates SRP. We refactored it into `ReportGenerator` (responsible only for generation) and `ReportPersistence` (responsible only for saving), adhering to SRP. Each class now has only one reason to change.

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

*   **Core Idea:** Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be **open for extension, but closed for modification.**
*   **Why it Matters:**
    *   **Flexibility:** New functionality can be added without changing existing, tested code.
    *   **Reduced Risk:** Minimizes the risk of introducing bugs into existing functionality.
    *   **Maintainability:** Codebase is more stable over time.
*   **Code Example:** Using interfaces/abstract classes and polymorphism.

    ```java
    // --- BEFORE OCP (Violation) ---
    class DiscountCalculator {
        // PROBLEM: Adding a new discount type (e.g., "Premium") requires modifying this method.
        public double calculateDiscount(String customerType, double price) {
            if ("Standard".equals(customerType)) {
                return price * 0.05;
            } else if ("Loyal".equals(customerType)) {
                return price * 0.10;
            }
            // What if we add "Premium", "VIP"? Need to add more else-if blocks.
            return 0;
        }
    }

    // --- AFTER OCP (Adherence) ---
    interface CustomerDiscount {
        double applyDiscount(double price);
    }

    class StandardCustomerDiscount implements CustomerDiscount {
        @Override
        public double applyDiscount(double price) {
            return price * 0.05;
        }
    }

    class LoyalCustomerDiscount implements CustomerDiscount {
        @Override
        public double applyDiscount(double price) {
            return price * 0.10;
        }
    }

    // NEW: Add Premium discount without modifying existing code
    class PremiumCustomerDiscount implements CustomerDiscount {
        @Override
        public double applyDiscount(double price) {
            return price * 0.15; // New discount logic
        }
    }

    // The calculator now uses the abstraction
    class DiscountProcessor {
         // The processor works with any implementation of CustomerDiscount
        public double processDiscount(CustomerDiscount discountStrategy, double price) {
            return discountStrategy.applyDiscount(price);
        }
    }

    // Usage:
    // DiscountProcessor processor = new DiscountProcessor();
    // double price = 100.0;
    // double standardDiscount = processor.processDiscount(new StandardCustomerDiscount(), price); // 5.0
    // double loyalDiscount = processor.processDiscount(new LoyalCustomerDiscount(), price);       // 10.0
    // double premiumDiscount = processor.processDiscount(new PremiumCustomerDiscount(), price);   // 15.0 - Added without changing DiscountProcessor
    ```
*   **Explanation:** Instead of using `if/else` in `DiscountCalculator`, we introduced the `CustomerDiscount` interface. Different discount types implement this interface. The `DiscountProcessor` works with the interface, allowing new discount types (`PremiumCustomerDiscount`) to be added without modifying `DiscountProcessor` or existing discount classes. It's open for extension (new `CustomerDiscount` implementations) but closed for modification (the `DiscountProcessor` doesn't change).

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

*   **Core Idea:** Subtypes must be **substitutable for their base types** without altering the correctness of the program. If class `S` is a subtype of class `T`, then objects of type `T` should be replaceable with objects of type `S` without breaking the program.
*   **Why it Matters:**
    *   **Reliability:** Ensures polymorphism works as expected.
    *   **Correct Inheritance:** Validates that the "is-a" relationship is behaviorally consistent.
    *   **Maintainability:** Prevents unexpected side effects when using subclasses.
*   **Code Example:** Classic Bird example.

    ```java
    // --- BEFORE LSP (Potential Violation) ---
    abstract class Bird {
        public abstract void fly(); // All birds are expected to fly?
    }

    class Sparrow extends Bird {
        @Override
        public void fly() {
            System.out.println("Sparrow flying high!");
        }
    }

    class Penguin extends Bird {
        @Override
        public void fly() {
            // Penguins cannot fly! This violates the expectation set by the base class.
            // Option 1: Do nothing (misleading)
            // Option 2: Throw an exception (breaks substitution)
             throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Penguins can't fly!");
        }
        public void swim() {
            System.out.println("Penguin swimming!");
        }
    }

    // Client code expecting any Bird to fly:
    // void makeBirdFly(Bird bird) {
    //     bird.fly(); // This will crash if bird is a Penguin! LSP Violation.
    // }

    // --- AFTER LSP (Adherence) ---
    // Option 1: More specific abstractions
    abstract class Bird {
        // Basic bird properties/methods common to all
    }

    abstract class FlyingBird extends Bird {
        public abstract void fly();
    }

    abstract class SwimmingBird extends Bird {
        public abstract void swim();
    }

    class SparrowLSP extends FlyingBird {
        @Override
        public void fly() {
            System.out.println("Sparrow flying high!");
        }
    }

    class PenguinLSP extends SwimmingBird { // Penguin doesn't extend FlyingBird
        @Override
        public void swim() {
            System.out.println("Penguin swimming!");
        }
    }

    // Client code now uses the correct abstraction:
    // void makeFlyingBirdFly(FlyingBird bird) {
    //     bird.fly(); // Safe - only works with birds that CAN fly.
    // }
    // void makeSwimmingBirdSwim(SwimmingBird bird) {
    //     bird.swim(); // Safe - works with birds that swim.
    // }
    ```
*   **Explanation:** The initial design forced `Penguin` to implement `fly()`, which it cannot do meaningfully, breaking substitutability. The refactored design separates flying behavior into a `FlyingBird` abstraction. `PenguinLSP` doesn't inherit `FlyingBird`, adhering to LSP. Clients now rely on the appropriate abstraction (`FlyingBird` or `SwimmingBird`).

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

*   **Core Idea:** Clients should **not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use**. Prefer smaller, cohesive interfaces over large, monolithic ones.
*   **Why it Matters:**
    *   **Reduced Coupling:** Clients only know about the methods relevant to them.
    *   **Improved Cohesion:** Interfaces have a clear, single purpose.
    *   **Flexibility:** Easier to implement interfaces; classes don't need to implement unnecessary methods.
*   **Code Example:**

    ```java
    // --- BEFORE ISP (Violation) ---
    interface Worker { // "Fat" interface
        void work();
        void eat();
        void sleep();
    }

    class HumanWorker implements Worker {
        @Override public void work() { System.out.println("Human working..."); }
        @Override public void eat() { System.out.println("Human eating..."); }
        @Override public void sleep() { System.out.println("Human sleeping..."); }
    }

    class RobotWorker implements Worker {
        @Override public void work() { System.out.println("Robot working..."); }
        // PROBLEM: Robots don't eat or sleep in the biological sense.
        // Forced to implement methods it doesn't need.
        @Override public void eat() { /* Do nothing or throw exception */ }
        @Override public void sleep() { /* Do nothing or throw exception */ }
    }

    // --- AFTER ISP (Adherence) ---
    // Segregated interfaces
    interface Workable { void work(); }
    interface Feedable { void eat(); }
    interface Restable { void sleep(); }

    // Implement only necessary interfaces
    class HumanWorkerISP implements Workable, Feedable, Restable {
        @Override public void work() { System.out.println("Human working..."); }
        @Override public void eat() { System.out.println("Human eating..."); }
        @Override public void sleep() { System.out.println("Human sleeping..."); }
    }

    class RobotWorkerISP implements Workable { // Only implements what it needs
        @Override public void work() { System.out.println("Robot working..."); }
    }

    // Client code can depend on specific capabilities:
    // void manageWorker(Workable worker) { worker.work(); }
    // void feedWorker(Feedable worker) { worker.eat(); }
    ```
*   **Explanation:** The initial `Worker` interface was too broad ("fat"). `RobotWorker` was forced to implement `eat()` and `sleep()`, violating ISP. We segregated the interface into smaller, role-specific interfaces (`Workable`, `Feedable`, `Restable`). Classes now implement only the interfaces relevant to them (`RobotWorkerISP` only implements `Workable`).

---

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

*   **Core Idea:**
    1.  High-level modules should **not depend on low-level modules**. Both should depend on **abstractions** (e.g., interfaces).
    2.  Abstractions should **not depend on details**. Details (concrete implementations) should depend on abstractions.
*   **Why it Matters:**
    *   **Decoupling:** High-level policy is not tied to low-level implementation details.
    *   **Flexibility/Swapability:** Easier to replace low-level implementations without affecting high-level modules (e.g., swap database types, notification methods).
    *   **Testability:** Allows mocking dependencies for unit testing. Often achieved using **Dependency Injection (DI)**.
*   **Code Example:**

    ```java
    // --- BEFORE DIP (Violation) ---
    // Low-level module
    class EmailNotifier {
        public void sendEmail(String message) {
            System.out.println("Sending Email: " + message);
        }
    }

    // High-level module
    class NotificationService {
        // PROBLEM: High-level NotificationService directly depends on low-level EmailNotifier.
        private EmailNotifier emailNotifier;

        public NotificationService() {
            this.emailNotifier = new EmailNotifier(); // Direct instantiation - tight coupling!
        }

        public void sendNotification(String message) {
            this.emailNotifier.sendEmail(message);
        }
        // Cannot easily switch to SMS or Push notification without changing this class.
    }

    // --- AFTER DIP (Adherence) ---
    // 1. Define an Abstraction
    interface MessageNotifier {
        void sendMessage(String message);
    }

    // 2. Low-level modules depend on the abstraction (by implementing it)
    class EmailNotifierDIP implements MessageNotifier {
        @Override
        public void sendMessage(String message) {
            System.out.println("Sending Email: " + message);
        }
    }

    class SmsNotifierDIP implements MessageNotifier { // Another implementation
        @Override
        public void sendMessage(String message) {
            System.out.println("Sending SMS: " + message);
        }
    }

    // 3. High-level module depends on the abstraction
    class NotificationServiceDIP {
        private final MessageNotifier notifier; // Depends on the INTERFACE

        // Dependency is injected (e.g., via constructor) - Loose coupling!
        public NotificationServiceDIP(MessageNotifier notifier) {
            this.notifier = notifier;
        }

        public void sendNotification(String message) {
            this.notifier.sendMessage(message); // Uses the interface method
        }
    }

    // Usage:
    // // We can easily switch the implementation!
    // MessageNotifier emailSender = new EmailNotifierDIP();
    // NotificationServiceDIP emailService = new NotificationServiceDIP(emailSender);
    // emailService.sendNotification("Hello via Email!");

    // MessageNotifier smsSender = new SmsNotifierDIP();
    // NotificationServiceDIP smsService = new NotificationServiceDIP(smsSender);
    // smsService.sendNotification("Hello via SMS!");
    ```
*   **Explanation:** Initially, `NotificationService` (high-level) directly created and used `EmailNotifier` (low-level), violating DIP. We introduced the `MessageNotifier` interface (abstraction). Both `EmailNotifierDIP` and `SmsNotifierDIP` (details) implement this interface. `NotificationServiceDIP` now depends only on the `MessageNotifier` interface, which is injected (Dependency Injection). This inverts the dependency – concrete details now depend on abstractions, and high-level modules depend on abstractions too.

**Conclusion for Interview:**

Understanding and applying SOLID principles leads to code that is easier to maintain, test, extend, and understand. In a system design context, these principles help create modular components with clear responsibilities and loose coupling, which are crucial for building scalable and resilient systems. Demonstrating knowledge of SOLID shows you care about code quality and long-term maintainability.
