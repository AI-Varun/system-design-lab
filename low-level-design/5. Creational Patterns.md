### 1.2 ‚öôÔ∏è LLD Core Building Blocks: Design Patterns

Welcome to one of the most critical sections for Low-Level Design interviews. Design Patterns are **proven, reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems** within a given context in software design. They are not specific algorithms or pieces of code, but rather templates or descriptions of how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

**Why are they so important?**
*   **Shared Vocabulary:** They provide a common language for developers to communicate complex design ideas efficiently. Saying "Let's use a Singleton for the logger" is much faster than describing the entire implementation.
*   **Proven Solutions:** These patterns have been time-tested and refined by many developers. They help you avoid reinventing the wheel and protect you from common pitfalls.
*   **Code Quality:** They often lead to more flexible, reusable, and maintainable code, demonstrating your ability to write production-quality software.

In LLD interviews, correctly identifying and applying a design pattern shows maturity as a developer and a deep understanding of OOP and SOLID principles.

This section is divided into three categories:
*   **Creational Patterns:** Focus on object creation mechanisms.
*   **Structural Patterns:** Focus on class and object composition.
*   **Behavioral Patterns:** Focus on object interaction and communication.

Let's begin with Creational Patterns.

---

### Creational Patterns: (How objects are created)

Creational patterns abstract the object-instantiation process. They help make a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented. They are crucial for creating flexible and loosely coupled systems.

---

### 1. Singleton Pattern üîí

*   **Core Idea:** Ensures that a class has **only one instance** and provides a **global point of access** to that instance.

*   **Analogy:** A country can have only one President or Prime Minister at a time. The office of the President is the global point of access. No matter who asks for the President, they are directed to the same single person holding the office.

*   **Purpose / When to Use It:**
    *   When exactly one instance of a class is needed to coordinate actions across the system.
    *   When the single instance should be extensible by subclassing, and clients should be able to use an extended instance without modifying their code.
    *   **Common Examples:** Logging services (`Logger`), configuration managers (`Configuration`), database connection pools, and hardware interface accessors.

*   **Key Characteristics:**
    *   **Private Constructor:** Prevents direct instantiation of the class with the `new` keyword from outside the class.
    *   **Private Static Instance:** A private static variable holds the single instance of the class.
    *   **Public Static Method:** A public static method (commonly named `getInstance()`) provides the global access point. It creates the instance if it doesn't exist and returns the existing instance otherwise.

*   **Implementation (Classic Lazy Initialization - Not Thread-Safe):**

    ```java
    // Classic Singleton implementation
    // NOTE: This version is NOT thread-safe!
    public class Logger {
        // 1. Private static variable to hold the single instance of the class.
        // "lazy initialization" - we only create it when it's first needed.
        private static Logger instance;

        // 2. Private constructor to prevent direct instantiation.
        private Logger() {
            // Simulate initialization overhead
            System.out.println("Logger instance created.");
        }

        // 3. Public static method to get the instance of the class.
        public static Logger getInstance() {
            // If the instance hasn't been created yet, create it.
            if (instance == null) {
                instance = new Logger();
            }
            return instance;
        }

        // Example business method
        public void log(String message) {
            System.out.println("LOG: " + message);
        }
    }

    // --- Demo ---
    public class SingletonDemo {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("--- Singleton Demo ---");
            Logger logger1 = Logger.getInstance();
            Logger logger2 = Logger.getInstance();

            logger1.log("This is the first message.");
            logger2.log("This is the second message.");

            // Verify that both references point to the same object
            if (logger1 == logger2) {
                System.out.println("Both logger1 and logger2 are the same instance.");
            } else {
                System.out.println("Singleton failed: different instances were created.");
            }
        }
    }
    /*
    Output:
    --- Singleton Demo ---
    Logger instance created.
    LOG: This is the first message.
    LOG: This is the second message.
    Both logger1 and logger2 are the same instance.
    */
    ```

*   **Variations & Advanced Concepts (Crucial for Interviews):**

    1.  **Thread-Safe Singleton (Synchronized Method):**
        *   **Problem:** The lazy initialization above can fail in a multi-threaded environment. Two threads could simultaneously find `instance == null` and both create a new object.
        *   **Solution:** Synchronize the `getInstance()` method. This is simple but has a performance cost, as the lock is acquired every time the method is called, even after the instance is created.

        ```java
        public static synchronized Logger getInstance() {
            if (instance == null) {
                instance = new Logger();
            }
            return instance;
        }
        ```

    2.  **Eager Initialization (Innately Thread-Safe):**
        *   **Solution:** Create the instance at the time of class loading. It's the simplest way to achieve thread safety.
        *   **Trade-off:** The instance is created even if it's never used, which might be a problem if it's a resource-heavy object.

        ```java
        public class EagerLogger {
            // Instance is created when the class is loaded.
            private static final EagerLogger instance = new EagerLogger();

            private EagerLogger() {}

            public static EagerLogger getInstance() {
                return instance;
            }
        }
        ```

    3.  **Double-Checked Locking (DCL):**
        *   **Solution:** A performance optimization over the synchronized method. It checks for `null` twice, with the `synchronized` block only entered if the instance is null, avoiding the lock overhead on subsequent calls.
        *   **Keyword:** The `instance` variable **must be declared `volatile`** to prevent compiler reordering issues, which could otherwise allow a partially constructed object to be returned.

        ```java
        public class DclLogger {
            // volatile is crucial here!
            private static volatile DclLogger instance;

            private DclLogger() {}

            public static DclLogger getInstance() {
                if (instance == null) { // First check (no lock)
                    synchronized (DclLogger.class) {
                        if (instance == null) { // Second check (with lock)
                            instance = new DclLogger();
                        }
                    }
                }
                return instance;
            }
        }
        ```

    4.  **Enum Singleton (The Best Approach):**
        *   **Solution:** A modern and highly recommended way to implement a Singleton. It's concise, provides serialization and thread-safety for free, and is protected against creation via reflection.
        *   **How:** Simply define an `enum` with a single instance.

        ```java
        public enum EnumLogger {
            INSTANCE; // The single instance

            // Constructor is implicitly private
            EnumLogger() {
                System.out.println("EnumLogger instance created.");
            }

            public void log(String message) {
                System.out.println("ENUM LOG: " + message);
            }
        }

        // Usage: EnumLogger.INSTANCE.log("Hello from enum!");
        ```

*   **Pros & Cons:**
    *   **Pros:**
        *   Guarantees a single instance.
        *   Provides a global point of access.
        *   Lazy initialization is possible.
    *   **Cons:**
        *   Violates the Single Responsibility Principle (it controls its own creation and lifecycle).
        *   Can be difficult to unit test (global state is hard to mock).
        *   Can mask bad design (e.g., components being too tightly coupled).
        *   Requires care in multi-threaded environments.

*   **LLD Interview Use Cases:**
    *   `Design a Logger`: Singleton is a classic choice for the logging utility.
    *   `Design a Parking Lot`: The `ParkingLot` class itself could be a Singleton, as there's only one parking lot in the system.
    *   `Design a Library Management System`: The `Library` itself could be a Singleton.

### 2. Factory Method Pattern üè≠

*   **Core Idea:** Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets **subclasses decide which class to instantiate**. It lets a class defer instantiation to its subclasses.

*   **Analogy:** A logistics company. The parent `Logistics` company has a `createTransport()` method, but it's abstract. The `RoadLogistics` subclass implements `createTransport()` to return a `Truck` object, while the `SeaLogistics` subclass implements it to return a `Ship` object. The core business logic in the `Logistics` class can plan a delivery using the `Transport` object without knowing if it's a Truck or a Ship.

*   **Purpose / When to Use It:**
    *   When a class cannot anticipate the class of objects it must create.
    *   When a class wants its subclasses to specify the objects it creates.
    *   To provide users of your library/framework with a way to extend its internal components.
    *   This pattern fully embraces the **Open/Closed Principle**.

*   **Key Characteristics:**
    *   **Product Interface:** Defines the interface for the objects the factory method creates.
    *   **Concrete Products:** Actual implementations of the Product interface.
    *   **Creator Class (often abstract):** Contains the core business logic that relies on Product objects. It declares the abstract `factoryMethod()` that returns a Product.
    *   **Concrete Creators:** Subclasses that override the `factoryMethod()` to produce and return a specific Concrete Product.

*   **Implementation:**

    ```java
    // 1. Product Interface
    interface Transport {
        void deliver();
    }

    // 2. Concrete Products
    class Truck implements Transport {
        @Override
        public void deliver() {
            System.out.println("Delivering by land in a truck.");
        }
    }

    class Ship implements Transport {
        @Override
        public void deliver() {
            System.out.println("Delivering by sea in a ship.");
        }
    }

    // 3. Creator Class (Abstract)
    abstract class Logistics {
        // Core business logic - it works with a product interface.
        public void planDelivery() {
            // The factory method is called to get the object.
            Transport t = createTransport();
            System.out.println("Planning delivery...");
            t.deliver();
        }

        // The factory method itself is abstract.
        // Subclasses will decide what concrete object to create.
        public abstract Transport createTransport();
    }

    // 4. Concrete Creators
    class RoadLogistics extends Logistics {
        // This subclass decides to create a Truck.
        @Override
        public Transport createTransport() {
            return new Truck();
        }
    }

    class SeaLogistics extends Logistics {
        // This subclass decides to create a Ship.
        @Override
        public Transport createTransport() {
            return new Ship();
        }
    }

    // --- Demo ---
    public class FactoryMethodDemo {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Logistics logistics;

            // Decide at runtime which factory to use based on configuration or environment.
            String transportType = "road"; // This could come from a config file

            if ("road".equalsIgnoreCase(transportType)) {
                logistics = new RoadLogistics();
            } else if ("sea".equalsIgnoreCase(transportType)) {
                logistics = new SeaLogistics();
            } else {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown transport type");
            }

            // The client code works with the abstract creator and does not know
            // about the concrete product types.
            logistics.planDelivery();
        }
    }
    /*
    Output:
    Planning delivery...
    Delivering by land in a truck.
    */
    ```

*   **Pros & Cons:**
    *   **Pros:**
        *   Avoids tight coupling between the creator and the concrete products.
        *   **Single Responsibility Principle:** You can move product creation logic into one place.
        *   **Open/Closed Principle:** You can introduce new product types without modifying existing client code.
    *   **Cons:**
        *   The codebase can become more complicated as you need to introduce a new hierarchy of creator classes.

*   **LLD Interview Use Cases:**
    *   `Design a Notification System`: A `NotificationFactory` can have subclasses like `EmailNotificationFactory`, `SmsNotificationFactory`, `PushNotificationFactory`, each creating the appropriate `Notification` object.
    *   `Design a Splitwise App`: A `ExpenseSplitFactory` could have subclasses `EqualSplitFactory`, `PercentageSplitFactory`, etc., to create different types of `Split` objects.

---

### 3. Abstract Factory Pattern üèõÔ∏è

*   **Core Idea:** Provides an interface for creating **families of related or dependent objects** without specifying their concrete classes. It's like a factory that creates other factories.

*   **Analogy:** A furniture manufacturer. An `AbstractFurnitureFactory` defines methods like `createChair()`, `createSofa()`, `createTable()`. You can then have a `ModernFurnitureFactory` that creates `ModernChair`, `ModernSofa`, and `ModernTable`, and a `VictorianFurnitureFactory` that creates `VictorianChair`, `VictorianSofa`, and `VictorianTable`. The key is that all furniture from one factory belongs to the same style (family).

*   **Purpose / When to Use It:**
    *   When your system needs to be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented.
    *   When a system is configured with one of multiple families of products.
    *   When you want to provide a library of products and you want to reveal just their interfaces, not their implementations.

*   **Key Characteristics:**
    *   **Abstract Factory Interface:** Declares a set of methods for creating abstract products.
    *   **Concrete Factories:** Implement the abstract factory's methods to create concrete products of a specific family.
    *   **Abstract Product Interfaces:** Define interfaces for a type of product within the family (e.g., `IChair`, `ISofa`).
    *   **Concrete Products:** Implement the abstract product interfaces and are created by concrete factories.

*   **Implementation:**

    ```java
    // 1. Abstract Product Interfaces
    interface IButton { void paint(); }
    interface ICheckbox { void paint(); }

    // 2. Concrete Products for Windows
    class WinButton implements IButton {
        @Override public void paint() { System.out.println("Painting a Windows button."); }
    }
    class WinCheckbox implements ICheckbox {
        @Override public void paint() { System.out.println("Painting a Windows checkbox."); }
    }

    // 2. Concrete Products for MacOS
    class MacButton implements IButton {
        @Override public void paint() { System.out.println("Painting a MacOS button."); }
    }
    class MacCheckbox implements ICheckbox {
        @Override public void paint() { System.out.println("Painting a MacOS checkbox."); }
    }

    // 3. Abstract Factory Interface
    interface IGUIFactory {
        IButton createButton();
        ICheckbox createCheckbox();
    }

    // 4. Concrete Factories for each OS/family
    class WinFactory implements IGUIFactory {
        @Override public IButton createButton() { return new WinButton(); }
        @Override public ICheckbox createCheckbox() { return new WinCheckbox(); }
    }

    class MacFactory implements IGUIFactory {
        @Override public IButton createButton() { return new MacButton(); }
        @Override public ICheckbox createCheckbox() { return new MacCheckbox(); }
    }

    // Client Code that uses the factory
    class Application {
        private final IButton button;
        private final ICheckbox checkbox;

        // The application doesn't know the concrete types. It gets a factory and asks it to create widgets.
        public Application(IGUIFactory factory) {
            button = factory.createButton();
            checkbox = factory.createCheckbox();
        }

        public void paintUI() {
            button.paint();
            checkbox.paint();
        }
    }

    // --- Demo ---
    public class AbstractFactoryDemo {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            // Determine OS at runtime
            String osName = System.getProperty("os.name").toLowerCase();
            IGUIFactory factory;

            if (osName.contains("win")) {
                factory = new WinFactory();
            } else {
                factory = new MacFactory(); // Default to Mac
            }

            Application app = new Application(factory);
            app.paintUI();
        }
    }
    /*
    Possible Output (depending on your OS):
    Painting a Windows button.
    Painting a Windows checkbox.
    */
    ```

*   **Pros & Cons:**
    *   **Pros:**
        *   Isolates concrete classes from the client.
        *   Makes exchanging product families easy.
        *   Promotes consistency among products in a family.
    *   **Cons:**
        *   Very difficult to add new *kinds* of products (e.g., adding `createTextBox()`) because it requires changing the Abstract Factory interface and all its subclasses.
        *   Can lead to a large number of new classes and interfaces.

*   **LLD Interview Use Cases:**
    *   `Design a UI Toolkit`: The classic example, creating families of UI elements for different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).
    *   `Design a Theming Engine`: Create families of themed components (e.g., `DarkThemeFactory`, `LightThemeFactory`) that produce themed buttons, panels, etc.

---

### 4. Builder Pattern üèóÔ∏è

*   **Core Idea:** Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, so that the same construction process can create different representations. It allows you to build a complex object step-by-step.

*   **Analogy:** Ordering a custom pizza or a Subway sandwich. You don't tell the cashier "Give me a veggie supreme on thin crust with extra cheese and olives." Instead, you go through a step-by-step process: "I'll start with a thin crust." -> "Add tomato sauce." -> "Add mozzarella and cheddar." -> "Add olives, peppers, and onions." Finally, you say "That's it," and the complete pizza is given to you. The builder guides you through the creation.

*   **Purpose / When to Use It:**
    *   When you have an object with many optional parameters or configurations. This helps avoid the "Telescoping Constructor" anti-pattern (constructors with a long list of parameters).
    *   When you want to create an **immutable object** but the creation logic is too complex for a single constructor.
    *   When the creation process involves multiple steps or requires a specific order.

*   **Key Characteristics:**
    *   **Product:** The complex object that is being built.
    *   **Builder (often a static nested class):** A class that knows how to build the Product step-by-step. It has methods for setting each part of the Product (e.g., `withCheese()`, `withSauce()`). These methods usually return the builder instance itself to allow for method chaining (a fluent interface).
    *   **`build()` method:** A final method on the builder that returns the fully constructed Product.

*   **Implementation:**

    ```java
    // 1. The Product class - complex and immutable
    public class HttpRequest {
        private final String method;    // required
        private final String url;       // required
        private final String body;      // optional
        private final String headers;   // optional
        private final int timeout;      // optional

        // Constructor is private, so it can only be called by the builder
        private HttpRequest(Builder builder) {
            this.method = builder.method;
            this.url = builder.url;
            this.body = builder.body;
            this.headers = builder.headers;
            this.timeout = builder.timeout;
        }

        @Override
        public String toString() {
            return "HttpRequest{" + "method='" + method + '\'' + ", url='" + url + '\'' + ", body='" + body + '\'' + ", headers='" + headers + '\'' + ", timeout=" + timeout + '}';
        }

        // 2. The static nested Builder class
        public static class Builder {
            // Replicate fields from the product, but make them mutable
            private final String method;
            private final String url;
            private String body = ""; // Default values
            private String headers = "Content-Type: application/json";
            private int timeout = 30;

            // Builder constructor takes the required fields
            public Builder(String method, String url) {
                this.method = method;
                this.url = url;
            }

            // Setter methods for optional fields, returning 'this' for chaining
            public Builder withBody(String body) {
                this.body = body;
                return this;
            }

            public Builder withHeaders(String headers) {
                this.headers = headers;
                return this;
            }

            public Builder withTimeout(int timeout) {
                this.timeout = timeout;
                return this;
            }

            // 3. The final build() method
            public HttpRequest build() {
                // Can add validation here before creating the object
                if (url == null || url.isEmpty()) {
                    throw new IllegalStateException("URL cannot be empty");
                }
                // Create the immutable HttpRequest object
                return new HttpRequest(this);
            }
        }
    }

    // --- Demo ---
    public class BuilderDemo {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            // Using the builder to create objects with a fluent API
            HttpRequest getRequest = new HttpRequest.Builder("GET", "https://api.example.com/data")
                    .withTimeout(15)
                    .build();

            HttpRequest postRequest = new HttpRequest.Builder("POST", "https://api.example.com/users")

*   **Pros & Cons:**
    *   **Pros:**
        *   Improves readability when creating complex objects.
        *   Avoids the telescoping constructor anti-pattern.
        *   Allows for the creation of immutable objects.
        *   Gives you more control over the construction process (can add validation in the `build()` method).
    *   **Cons:**
        *   Increases the amount of code; you have to create a separate builder for each class.
        *   Can be more verbose than a simple constructor if the object is not complex.

*   **LLD Interview Use Cases:**
    *   `Design an API Query Builder`: Perfect for building complex database or API queries step-by-step (`.where()`, `.orderBy()`, `.limit()`).
    *   `Design a User Profile`: A `User` object can have many optional fields (bio, website, profile picture, etc.).
    *   `Design a Vending Machine`: A `Product` object within the machine could be built with options like `withSugar()`, `withMilk()`, etc.

### 5. Prototype Pattern üß¨

*   **Core Idea:** Creates new objects by **copying an existing object**, known as the "prototype".

*   **Analogy:** A rubber stamp. You create one master stamp (the prototype), and then you can quickly create many identical copies by inking it and pressing it on paper. This is much faster than carving a new stamp from scratch every time.

*   **Purpose / When to Use It:**
    *   When the cost of creating an object is expensive or complex (e.g., involves a database call, a network request, or heavy computation).
    *   When you need many objects that are identical or very similar to each other.
    *   When you want to hide the complexity of object creation from the client.

*   **Key Characteristics:**
    *   **Prototype Interface:** Declares a `clone()` method. In Java, this is often achieved using the built-in `Cloneable` interface and overriding the `Object.clone()` method.
    *   **Concrete Prototype:** The class that implements the `clone()` method to make a copy of itself.
    *   **Prototype Registry (Optional but common):** A helper class that manages a set of pre-built, ready-to-clone prototypes, identified by a key.

*   **Implementation (with Shallow vs. Deep Copy discussion):**

    ```java
    // Example of a mutable object to show difference between shallow/deep copy
    class Engine {
        private String type;
        public Engine(String type) { this.type = type; }
        public String getType() { return type; }
        public void setType(String type) { this.type = type; }
        @Override public String toString() { return "Engine [type=" + type + "]"; }
    }

    // 1. Prototype Interface (using Java's Cloneable)
    abstract class Vehicle implements Cloneable {
        private String brand;
        private String model;
        protected Engine engine; // Reference to another object

        public Vehicle(String brand, String model, Engine engine) {
            this.brand = brand;
            this.model = model;
            this.engine = engine;
        }

        // Getters and Setters
        public String getBrand() { return brand; }
        public void setBrand(String brand) { this.brand = brand; }
        public Engine getEngine() { return engine; }

        @Override
        public String toString() {
            return "Vehicle [brand=" + brand + ", model=" + model + ", engine=" + engine + "]";
        }

        // The clone method is the core of the pattern
        @Override
        public Vehicle clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
            // By default, Object.clone() performs a SHALLOW COPY.
            // This means primitive fields are copied, but reference fields
            // (like our 'engine' object) point to the SAME object in memory.
             System.out.println("Cloning Vehicle (Shallow Copy)...");
             return (Vehicle) super.clone();
        }
    }

    // 2. Concrete Prototype
    class Car extends Vehicle {
        public Car(String brand, String model, Engine engine) {
            super(brand, model, engine);
        }

        // DEEP COPY implementation
        @Override
        public Car clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
            System.out.println("Cloning Car (Deep Copy)...");
            // First, perform a shallow copy to get primitives right.
            Car clonedCar = (Car) super.clone();
            // Now, explicitly clone the mutable reference objects.
            clonedCar.engine = new Engine(this.engine.getType()); // Create a new Engine
            return clonedCar;
        }
    }

    // --- Demo ---
    public class PrototypeDemo {
        public static void main(String[] args) throws CloneNotSupportedException {
            System.out.println("--- Shallow Copy Demo ---");
            // The Vehicle class uses shallow copy by default
            Vehicle originalVehicle = new Vehicle("Toyota", "Camry", new Engine("V6"));
            Vehicle clonedVehicle = originalVehicle.clone();

            System.out.println("Original: " + originalVehicle);
            System.out.println("Cloned:   " + clonedVehicle);

            // Modify the engine of the cloned vehicle
            clonedVehicle.getEngine().setType("V8");

            // PROBLEM: The original vehicle's engine is also changed!
            System.out.println("After modifying cloned engine...");
            System.out.println("Original: " + originalVehicle); // Engine is now V8!
            System.out.println("Cloned:   " + clonedVehicle);

            System.out.println("\n--- Deep Copy Demo ---");
            // The Car class overrides clone() to perform a deep copy
            Car originalCar = new Car("Honda", "Civic", new Engine("V4"));
            Car clonedCar = originalCar.clone();

            System.out.println("Original: " + originalCar);
            System.out.println("Cloned:   " + clonedCar);

             // Modify the engine of the cloned car
            clonedCar.getEngine().setType("Turbo");

            // SUCCESS: The original car's engine is NOT changed.
            System.out.println("After modifying cloned engine...");
            System.out.println("Original: " + originalCar); // Engine remains V4.
            System.out.println("Cloned:   " + clonedCar);
        }
    }
    ```

*   **Shallow vs. Deep Copy (Crucial Interview Topic):**
    *   **Shallow Copy:** Copies only the top-level fields. If a field is a reference to another object, only the reference is copied, not the object itself. Both original and clone will point to the *same* sub-object.
    *   **Deep Copy:** Copies all fields and recursively clones any referenced objects. Original and clone are completely independent.
    *   **Rule of Thumb:** If your object contains only primitive types and immutable objects (like `String`), a shallow copy is sufficient. If it contains references to mutable objects, you almost always need a deep copy to avoid unintended side effects.

*   **Pros & Cons:**
    *   **Pros:**
        *   Can be faster than creating complex objects from scratch.
        *   Hides the complexity of object creation from the client.
        *   You can add and remove products at runtime by registering/unregistering prototypes.
    *   **Cons:**
        *   Cloning complex objects with circular references can be very tricky.
        *   Requires careful implementation of the `clone()` method, especially for deep copies.
