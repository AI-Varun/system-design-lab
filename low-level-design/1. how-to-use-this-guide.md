## 🤔 General Interview Strategy & Tips

*   **Understand the Framework:** Follow a structured approach (e.g., Clarify -> Scope -> Design -> Deep Dive -> Tradeoffs -> Summary).
*   **Ask Clarifying Questions:** Never assume. Understand requirements, constraints, scale (QPS, data size, users).
*   **State Assumptions:** Clearly state any assumptions you make.
*   **Start High-Level:** Sketch the main components and interactions first.
*   **Deep Dive:** Drill down into specific components, discussing data models, APIs, algorithms.
*   **Identify Bottlenecks:** Proactively identify potential performance issues and areas that need scaling.
*   **Discuss Tradeoffs:** Every choice has pros and cons (e.g., consistency vs. availability, latency vs. cost). Articulate them clearly.
*   **Be Pragmatic:** Choose proven technologies unless you have a strong reason not to. Justify your choices.
*   **Communicate Clearly:** Think out loud. Use diagrams. Engage the interviewer.
*   **Practice, Practice, Practice:** Whiteboard designs, discuss with peers, do mock interviews.
